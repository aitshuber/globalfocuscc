        <h1>Critical Chain Project Management - CCPM</h1>
        <h3>Why Critical Chain?</h3>
        <p>Why the Critical Chain approach to Project Management? &nbsp;Simply because the current methods
            are not working!&nbsp;Project Teams are expected to complete Projects before or on the committed
            due date, within budget and without compromise to the original specification. History shows a
            pattern of project underperformance, with most projects not meeting one or more of these
            expectations. Many external factors are blamed for this under performance; however the Project
            Management method is not questioned. <span style="font-size: 1.2em; line-height: 1.7;">&nbsp;&nbsp;<br/>

        <h3>Buffer Management - an effective early warning system</h3>
        <p>Critical Chain is the longest chain of Task and Resource dependency (the Critical Chain), which
            includes resolving Resource contention. The Critical Chain method includes: A single main
            Project Buffer at the end of the longest chain of resource and dependent tasks and a number of
            Feeding Buffers automatically inserted at integration points with the Critical Chain. Buffers
            provide an effective early warning signal and will pinpoint where timely intervention is
            required when there is task slippage.</p>
