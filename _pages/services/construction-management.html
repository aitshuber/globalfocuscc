                    <h3>Productivity buys strategy &nbsp;- &nbsp;reliability buys market share</h3>
                    <p>Productivity is the currency of Strategy - direct your company’s energy and talents toward
                        creating new opportunities while eliminating wasted time and resolving reoccurring problems.
                        Being recognized as a reliable supplier has significant value in the marketplace, both to retain
                        existing customers and to attract new customers.&nbsp;</p>
                    <h3>Does you Company experience any of the following symptoms?</h3>
                    <p>Unreliable Due Date Performance; RM, WIP, FG Inventory too high; Longer than desired Lead Times;
                        Frequent schedule changes?&nbsp;These symptoms create a climate of internal conflict&nbsp;between
                        Sales and Operations and externally by straining the relationship between your company and your
                        customers.</p>
