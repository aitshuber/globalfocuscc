                <h3 style="color: #365697; text-transform: capitalize;">On-time delivery captures market share</h3>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 20px; word-wrap: break-word;">Sales and Sales growth are driven by customer
                    needs – the more significant the customer need, the greater the opportunity to capture market share.&nbsp;When
                    customers experience poor on-time delivery, receive incomplete orders and have few alternative
                    suppliers, then finding a Reliable Supplier is the customer’s significant need.</p>
                <h3 style="color: #365697; text-transform: capitalize;">rapid response and guaranteed Supplier
                    reliability &amp; availability</h3>
                <span style="font-size: 13px;">Rapid Response, Guaranteed Reliability and Guaranteed Availability are attributes customers place ahead of lower price or additional technical features. Have you calculated the impact of unavailability and lost market share? The good news is that ample opportunity exists, most markets are underserved when the impact of delays are correctly&nbsp;calculated. Capitalizing on these underserved markets starts with Supply Chain Management. &nbsp;Guaranteed on-time delivery and/or rapid response to customer needs mandates the synchronization of all supply chain participants - Manufacturing, Production and Assembly, Distribution and even Retail. &nbsp;Receive significant value when increasing the agility of the Supply Chain within a short period.</span>

                    <h3 style="color: #365697; text-transform: capitalize;">impact of Over or Under Inventory levels&nbsp;</h3>
                    <span style="font-size: 13px;">When customers&nbsp;<span
                            style="line-height: 19px;">experience</span>&nbsp;any distortion in Inventory levels e.g. too much of the "wrong" stock, while simultaneously hoding too little of the "right" stock, the result is:</span>
                    <p style="margin-bottom: 20px; word-wrap: break-word;"><span
                            style="line-height: 19px; font-size: 13px;"></span></p>
                    <ul style="margin-bottom: 20px; padding-left: 16px; list-style: none;">
                        <li style="padding-bottom: 3px; padding-left: 16px; background-image: url(http://globalfocus.accoladescms.com/images/arrow-bullet.png); background-position: 0px 5px; background-repeat: no-repeat no-repeat;">
                            Over-inventory resulting in excessive discounting, stock obsolescence, cash tied up in slow
                            moving materials and significant capacity wastage.
                        </li>
                        <li style="padding-bottom: 3px; padding-left: 16px; background-image: url(http://globalfocus.accoladescms.com/images/arrow-bullet.png); background-position: 0px 5px; background-repeat: no-repeat no-repeat;">
                            Under-inventory resulting in missed sales, lost reputation and delivery delays leading to a
                            slow response to customer needs.<br/>
                            <br/>
                            Then Guaranteed Availability becomes a customer’s significant need.
