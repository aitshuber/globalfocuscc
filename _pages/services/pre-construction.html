    <h1>Change Management</h1>
    <h3>Collaboration - the greatest business strategy</h3>
    <p>What discourages some, is exactly what motivates Leaders. &nbsp;Initiating and communicating
        Change requires Leadership. &nbsp;An organization, department or individual is typically in one
        of 3 states of mind: &nbsp;Ambitious, Complacent or In Crisis! &nbsp; Does your Organization
        have the will to commit? &nbsp;Achieving internal and external collaboration is an organizations
        most effective strategic advantage. &nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1.2em; line-height: 1.7;">&nbsp;</span>

    <h3>Communication - How to initiate Change</h3>
    <p>The current trend determines the need for Change and answers the question, "Why Change at all?".
        &nbsp;</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Why Change? &nbsp;The Current Environment.</li>
        <li>What to Change? &nbsp;Recognizing an underlying Dilemma.</li>
        <li>What to Change to? &nbsp;Constructing the Solution.</li>
        <li>How to Cause the Change? &nbsp;Execution.&nbsp;</li>
        <li>How to Sustain the Change? &nbsp;The Process of Ongoing Improvement.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Identify and Manage the Value and Risks associated with Change</h4>
    <p>Humans are contrarians by nature: &nbsp;Provide humans with a solution - they will list the
        reasons why this solution will not work! &nbsp;Give humans a problem - they have a list of
        unsolicited advice! &nbsp;Not everyone is thrilled with the prospect of change. &nbsp;Often the
        strongest resistance to change is experienced internally.<br/>
        Identify and manage the Value and Risks (predicted negative outcomes and emotional obstacles) in
        order to gain internal collaboration from colleagues as they invest their reputation and
        careers.</p>
