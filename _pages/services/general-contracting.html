                    <h3>Create a Decisive Competitive Edge</h3>
                    <p>There is nothing more important externally to the Company than Sales. &nbsp;Sales are the engine
                        leading Company growth -pulling the Company into the future. Teams learn and apply specialized
                        critical thinking skills to analyze, develop and customize a Decisive Competitive Edge for your
                        Company. &nbsp;Know the customer's deep needs better than the customer understands their own
                        needs. Build a Decisive Competitive Edge and the capabilities to capitalize on it, for large
                        enough markets without exhausting the Company's resources and without taking real risks. The
                        Decisive Competitive Edge will form the basis of the Unrefuseable Market Offers (Mafia
                        Offers).</p>
                    <h3>Communicate Value to your Customers</h3>
                    <p>The voice of the customer is frequently misleading. &nbsp;It is possible to train individuals and
                        employees to discern only the&nbsp;relevant&nbsp;facts that expose true customer needs. &nbsp;Focus
                        on selling Value to the point where any discussion on price is reduced to an insignificant part
                        of the conversation. &nbsp;Sales Teams learn how to create and communicate value-based Sales
                        Offers tailored to chosen market segments.</p>
                    <h3>Sales Training - Identify Dealmakers, transfer the Sales knowledge</h3>
                    <p>The real Dealmakers are those&nbsp;individuals&nbsp;who consistently outperform the average Sales
                        person. &nbsp;They are able to understand an communicate the intrinsic value of the company
                        offering to customers. During the analysis, the experience and skills of the Dealmakers is
                        captured and transferred to the rest of the Sales Team. Once a customized Sales Process is
                        developed and the Market Offers are proven, the average Sales Team members are equipped to
                        perform as well as the Dealmakers.</p>
                    <h3>Manage the Sales Pipeline</h3>
                    <p>Focus and refocus on the most lucrative market opportunities - select a large market, with a
                        significant unresolved problem, where the Company has the best access. &nbsp;Focus Sales Team
                        efforts on the best opportunities. &nbsp;Restricting the number of&nbsp;opportunities&nbsp;increases
                        closure rates and significantly increases Sales. This may seem counter intuitive, however
                        consider how many great opportunities are lost due to unfocused or lack of Sales Team attention.<br/>
