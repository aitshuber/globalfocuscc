    <h1>Management Development</h1>
    <h3>Create depth on the managerial bench</h3>
    <p>The Primary Constraint to real, sustainable growth, is Management. &nbsp;Company ambitions and
        strategies can easily outpace the capability of Management. Senior Management can typically
        visualize and execute the strategies. Middle Management and Supervisors typically bear the brunt
        of changing processes along with rapid growth. The first wave of a strategy typically yields
        results, subsequent ambitions are limited by the capability of middle Management and Supervisors
        capacity and capability.</p>
    <p><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Removing the large obstacles and initiating major strategies exposes multiple small improvement opportunities. These become distracting to Middle Management and Supervisors, as they become aware of the multiple issues that require improvement. As operational flow starts to increase, the impact of minor problems are amplified.  Knowing where to focus can be overwhelming, due to the many issues once disguised, are now suddenly visible.</span>
    </p>
    <p>The best Managers are Team Coaches. Developing people, creating depth on the Managerial bench and
        developing the next generation of Management is an imperative for the stability and
        sustainability of company performance and growth.</p>
    <h3>Reward system with Short Term Metrics</h3>
    <span style="font-size: 13px;">"Show me how you measure me, and I will show you how I behave." Dr Eli Goldratt.</span>
    <p>A secondary effect is the reward system which often focuses on short-term performance. Employees
        tend to focus on the day-to-day operations in order to achieve the bonus metrics. This dilutes
        the efforts of major process improvement initiatives, which have a longer term outlook on
        growth, rather than a short-term reward.</p>
    <h3>Provide Management with the Tools and skills to succeed</h3>
    <span style="font-size: 13px;">Achieving internal and external Collaboration is an organizations most effective strategic advantage. &nbsp;Most individuals honestly claim to be part of the solution rather than part of a problem. &nbsp;Intentions are good, but somehow still end up in conflict. &nbsp;<span
            style="font-size: 12px; line-height: 20px;">Compromise is temporary, delaying the inevitable is not a sustainable solution. &nbsp;Conflict is always at the threshold of a breakthrough - avoiding conflict is to avoid an opportunity for breakthrough and progress. &nbsp;</span>Promote rapid resolution of problems and conflicts encountered in normal daily activities to ensure effective delegation and communication between employees and team members. In order to ensure&nbsp;<span
