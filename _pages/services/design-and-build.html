                    <h1>Corporate Strategy</h1>
                    <h3>Strategies are only as effective as their execution</h3>
                    <p>Executive Teams and Companies all have a Corporate Strategy. However a Strategy is only as
                        effective as the successful Execution of this Strategy, otherwise it will remain just another
                        Strategy!&nbsp;</p>
                    <h3>Prepare for the future</h3>
                    <p>Many Companies wait for the future to unfold, essentially waiting until it is too late. &nbsp;Companies
                        are either behind or ahead of emerging trends - both situations exhaust management, stretch
                        resources and force Companies to take unnecessary risks. What is your&nbsp;Corporate&nbsp;Strategy
                        and how well is your Company positioned to take advantage of this changing Global economy?
                        &nbsp;</p>
                    <h3>Develop Breakthrough Strategies</h3>
                    <p>Start by identifying the largest market(s) experiencing significant problems that your company
                        core skills or products can realistically resolve. &nbsp;Then select the most&nbsp;desirable&nbsp;customers
                        within these markets, thereafter align every function and activity towards addressing these
                        customers' under-served needs. &nbsp; Opportunity is always present, even in tough economic
                        times.</p>
                    <h3>Strategic Facilitation - Board Facilitation and corporate Retreats</h3>
