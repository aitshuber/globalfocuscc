                    <h3>develop breakthrough strategies and solutions</h3>
                    <p>Executives, Managers and key personnel learn the critical thinking skills by applying the Theory
                        of&nbsp;Constraints&nbsp;Thinking&nbsp;Process. &nbsp;Use the Thinking Process to develop a
                        breakthrough company strategy or finalize an existing Strategy through Analysis, construction of
                        a Solution and developing an Implementation Plan. &nbsp;Analyze subjects that have&nbsp;plagued&nbsp;the
                        Company for years - subjects that have no apparent solution. &nbsp;Discover the Root Cause
                        hampering progress within your company. &nbsp;When resolved, learn how to communicate
                        effectively to motivate and mobilize&nbsp;participation&nbsp;to ensure the collaboration of all
                        departments and across functions during execution of the unique solution.</p>
                    <h3>Executives, Managers And Key Personnel</h3>
                    <p>Develop significant insight and intuition by learning and applying rules for rigorous Cause and
                        Effect relationships to identify and capitalize on missed opportunities or overcoming
                        stagnation. Hidden Assumptions are challenged, unique solutions are constructed and
                        implementation plans are developed by surfacing and overcoming the Obstacles to implementation.&nbsp;<br/>
                        <br/>
                        The Thinking Process becomes part of an Executives tool set for strategic purposes, planning and
                        execution of initiatives as well as daily activities such as resolving conflicts, promoting
                        group collaboration and the evaluation of new ideas.</p>

                    <h3>Thinking Process - Market Segmentation</h3>
                    <p>Competition has increased significantly; the traditional Company response has been to develop new
                        products, new features and/or lowering prices. &nbsp;Adding new products and/or features
                        requires investment with an uncertain reward, while lowering prices only deteriorates into a
                        price war. &nbsp;The solution is to construct an Unrefuseable Offer or "Mafia Offer" for new and
                        existing markets, an offer customers cannot refuse. How is this accomplished? By learning and
                        applying specialized critical thinking skills and analysis, your Sales Team will acquire the
                        ability to develop and customize a Decisive Competitive Edge, resulting in unique Sales Offers
                        to your Clients. Your Sales Team will be able to communicate a Unique Offer with a high
                        perception of value, understood and appreciated by your clients.</p>

                        will:</p>
