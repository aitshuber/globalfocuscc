                <h1>Critical Chain Project Management</h1>
                <p>Why the Critical Chain approach to Project Management? &nbsp;Simply because the current methods are
                    not working! Project Teams are expected to complete Projects before or on the committed due date,
                    within budget and without compromise to the original specification. History shows a pattern of
                    project underperformance, with most projects not meeting one or more of these expectations. Many
                    external factors are blamed for this under performance; however the Project Management method is not
                    questioned.</p>

                <h1>Change Management</h1>
                <p>What discourages some, is exactly what motivates Leaders. &nbsp;Initiating and communicating Change
                    requires Leadership. &nbsp;An organization, department or individual is typically in one of 3 states
                    of mind: &nbsp;Ambitious, Complacent or In Crisis! &nbsp; Does your Organization have the will to
                    commit? &nbsp;Achieving internal and external collaboration is an organizations most effective
                    strategic advantage.</p>

                <h1>Corporate Strategy</h1>
                <p>Executive Teams and Companies all have a Corporate Strategy. A Strategy is only as effective as the
                    successful Execution of this Strategy, otherwise it will remain just another Strategy! Many
                    Executives and Managers are disappointed with the rate of progress and results. Achieve significant
                    progress in a very short time by using an experienced Strategic Facilitator for your Strategy
                    Meetings and Corporate Retreats. We have well designed and proven facilitation methods to achieve
                    results.</p>

                <h1>Sales and Marketing - Decisive Competitive Edge</h1>
                <p>There is nothing more important externally to the Company than Sales. Sales are the engine leading
                    company growth, pulling the company into the future. Teams learn and apply specialized critical
                    thinking skills to analyze, develop and customize a Decisive Competitive Edge for your Company.

                    without exhausting the Company's resources and without taking real risks. The Decisive Competitive
                    Edge will form the basis of the Unrefuseable Market Offers (Mafia Offers).</p>

                <h1>TOC Thinking Process - Market Segmentation</h1>
                <p>Adding new products and/or features requires investment with an uncertain reward, while lowering
                    prices only deteriorates into a price war. &nbsp;The solution is to construct an Unrefuseable Market
                    Offer or "Mafia Offer" for new and existing markets. Learn how to apply critical thinking skills and
                    analysis to selected market segments. Your Executives, Management or Sales Teams will acquire the
                    ability to develop and customize a Decisive Competitive Edge, resulting in unique Sales Offers to
                    your Customers.&nbsp;</p>

                <h1>TOC Thinking Process</h1>
                <p>Internal Company analysis: Analyze subjects that have plagued the Company for years - subjects that
                    have no apparent solution. &nbsp;Discover the Root Cause hampering progress within your company.
                    &nbsp;When resolved, learn how to communicate effectively to motivate and mobilize participation to
                    ensure the collaboration of all departments and across functions during Execution of the unique
                    solution.</p>

                <h1>Management Development and Training</h1>
                <p>The Primary Constraint to real, sustainable growth is Management. &nbsp;Company ambitions and
                    strategies can easily outpace the capability of Management. Senior Management can typically
                    visualize and execute the strategies. Middle Management and Supervisors typically bear the brunt of
                    changing processes along with rapid growth. The best Managers are Team Coaches. Developing people,
                    creating depth on the Managerial bench and developing the next generation of Management is an
                    imperative for the stability and sustainability of company performance and growth.</p>

                <h1>Production Scheduling</h1>
                <p>Productivity is the currency of Strategy - direct your company&rsquo;s energy and talents toward
                    creating new opportunities while eliminating wasted time and resolving reoccurring problems.
                    Unreliable Due Date Performance; RM, WIP, FG Inventory too high; Longer than desired Lead Times;
                    Frequent schedule changes? Identify and systematically remove the operational Constraints. Even in
                    well-run operations there is significant room for improvement. A 40% increase in freed capacity is
                    not unusual &ndash; by breaking internal dependency, correctly recognizing and managing constraints
                    and bottlenecks, stabilizing schedules and correctly sizing batches.</p>

                <h1>Supply Chain Logistics</h1>
                <p>Sales and Sales growth are driven by customer needs &ndash; the more significant the customer need,
                    the greater the opportunity to capture market share. When customers experience poor on-time
                    delivery, receive incomplete orders and have few alternative suppliers, then finding a Reliable
                    Supplier is the customer&rsquo;s significant need. Rapid Response, Guaranteed Reliability and
                    Guaranteed Availability are attributes customers place ahead of lower price or additional technical
                    features. Guaranteed on-time delivery and/or rapid response to customer needs mandates the
                    synchronization of all supply chain participants - Manufacturing, Production and Assembly,
                    Distribution and even Retail. Receive significant value when increasing the agility of the Supply
                    Chain within a short period.</p>
